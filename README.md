# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration
PhonePe, founded in 2015, is contributing to India's digital payments revolution with PhonePe Pulse, offering granular data and insights to support widespread digitization from towns to villages. The initiative is part of the API-driven transformation backed by the central bank and the government.

Languages Used Python, Streamlit, Mysql.
Plotly  and matplotlib for Data visualization

The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:

Data Extraction: Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

Data Transformation: Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

Database Insertion: Storing transformed data in a MYSQL database.

Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.
